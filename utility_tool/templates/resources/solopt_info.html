<b>Solution Options: </b><font color="blue">Resources to help you identify possible programs, tools or strategies to address the decision problem you have articulated</font>
<br><br></b><font color="blue">What are Solution Options?</font>
<br><br>Solution Options are programs/strategies/tools/individuals that could potentially address the problem that prompted this decision-making process, i.e., they are potential “answers” or solutions to your problem. For example, if you are looking for a Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) program to implement in K-12 schools to address high suspension rates and conflict between students, two Solution Options you might consider are RULER and Character First.
<br><br></b><font color="blue">Where can I find Solution Options?</font>
<br><br>It may be the case that you have ideas for Solution Options right away, or you may want to ask stakeholders to help you come up with ideas.
<br><br>To identify potential Solution Options for your decision problem, there are a variety of resources you might consult. Potential sources of information include:
<br><li>     Repositories of research or databases of programs that have been evaluated - see links to several below. </li>
<li>   Publications (practitioner publications, trade publications or peer-reviewed journals)</li>  
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"> Literature reviews or meta-analyses on a particular type of intervention might be especially useful to consult. A meta-analysis is a study that combines information from a number of independent studies on the same subject to try to draw a conclusion about general trends.  </p>
<li>       Network events or professional association meetings</li>  
<li>   Colleagues at your institution</li>  
<li>   Colleagues at other institutions</li>  
<li>   Vendors</li>  
<li>   Consultants</li>  
<li>      Professional development sessions</li>  
<li>   Research or technical assistance centers, e.g., <b><a href="https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/edlabs/" target="_blank">Regional Educational Labs</a></b></li>  
<br>Sometimes, establishing a list of Screening Criteria (non-negotiable requirements) first can help you develop a list of viable Solution Options, especially if there could be many different Solution Options and/or you need some guideposts to facilitate brainstorming. For example, imagine that your decision problem is how to provide out-of-school instruction to students who are on long-term suspension or medical leave. Before brainstorming Solution Options, you could check your state’s regulations on what is required under these circumstances. If you are in a state such as New Jersey, you would discover that any solution to this problem must involve at least 10 hours per week of face-to-face and one-to-one interactions between the student and a certified teacher. This immediately rules out some potential Solution Options like having these students participate in regular classes by teleconference or take online courses without teacher supervision.
<br><br></b><font color="blue">How many Solution Options should I consider?</font>
<br><br>The optimal number of Solution Options to consider will depend on the decision problem at hand and the time and capacity you have available for identifying and evaluating the options. You can add new Solution Options to consider at any time in the decision-making process and “put away” those Solution Options that are clearly not meeting your criteria. 
<br><br>For example, if you are trying to select a reading curriculum for struggling readers, gathering relevant information on each Solution Option and thoroughly evaluating each potential curriculum could be a very time-consuming process. In this situation, you would want to ensure that the number of options considered is not too large to preclude a thorough evaluation: 3-6 options might be a feasible number.
<br><br>However, a different kind of decision problem, such as ranking budget items to prioritize them for funding, might involve several hundred options. In this case, you would want to devise a less onerous process of gathering relevant information and evaluating each budget item.
<br><br>Note that if you start with a long list of Solution Options, you can use <b><a href="/utility_tool/resources/scr_info.html">Screening Criteria</a></b> to narrow down the list until you have a more manageable set to consider thoroughly.
<br><br></b><font color="blue"> How do I know which information sources are likely to yield suitable Solution Options?</font>
<br><br>The source of your information may determine the extent to which the potential Solution Option is applicable to your context, and also how reliable the information is. Imagine that you are making a decision to select a reading curriculum for elementary school students and a large majority of your students are English Language Learners (ELLs). Looking for potential reading curricula (Solution Options) in peer-reviewed journals may produce very reliable information about the efficacy of each curriculum in the context studied, but your context may be quite different. Perhaps the study populations contained a very low proportion of ELL students, so even though you trust that the curricula worked well for students in the studies, you are not sure whether that will translate to your own students. You can use DecisionMaker’s Relevance Index  to help you decide whether a study is relevant enough to your context to give you confidence that the study’s results might apply in your situation.
<br><br>Alternatively, a curriculum recommended by someone from another school in your district with a similar proportion of ELL students may appear to be more suitable for your context but may not have been evaluated rigorously for effectiveness at improving reading outcomes. You will need to consider this trade-off between suitability and reliability when identifying potential Solution Options. It is also important to consider how well each Solution Option interacts with existing policies and regulations in your context. Hence, an option used by another school in your district subject to similar policies and regulations may be the most viable to implement in your context. As a result, you might decide to score a curriculum recommended by a neighboring school higher on “fit with local context” than a curriculum you find in a peer-reviewed journal, but lower on evidence of effectiveness.
<br><br> Bearing these considerations in mind, any of the avenues listed above and below are viable places to start looking for information. We recommend that, once you do have some Solution Options in mind, you use repositories of research to check whether rigorous studies of effectiveness have been conducted in the past, and whether they found positive impacts. If not, you may want to consider piloting some Solution Options to evaluate them in your own context.

You can use the links below to find reports of educational programs and strategies that have been rigorously studied. These may come in the form of individual evaluation reports or studies, or systematic reviews, which synthesize findings from many studies of programs under one theme.

<br><br> 
<b><a href="https://scholar.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Scholar:</a></b> You can search by key word for scholarly publications on any topic including peer-reviewed articles, evaluation reports, and white papers.  These have not been vetted by Google, so you will need to carefully assess the sources and credibility of any documents you find here. Note that peer-reviewed publications often prefer that authors avoid naming specific programs and products.  Also, some peer-reviewed journals may be behind a paywall.  Sometimes you can find a free, pre-print version of the same paper on the internet by copying and pasting the title of the paper into your search engine.
