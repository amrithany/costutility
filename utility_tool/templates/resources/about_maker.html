        <h4 style="color:blue;"><b>About <i>DecisionMaker</i></b></h4>
        <br>The purpose of <i>DecisionMaker</i> is to facilitate school, district, or state education agency decisions that require a choice between alternative educational programs, strategies, or tools, for example, when choosing among several math curricula or digital devices, or when considering several scale up/scale down scenarios. You can use <i>DecisionMaker</i> to work through a decision alone or in collaboration with stakeholders.
        <br><br><i>DecisionMaker</i> provides a decision-making framework which you will navigate by clicking on icons in a flowchart, iterating steps as needed. Decision-makers are invited to identify factors important in distinguishing between alternative Solution Options and to gather evidence to determine which Solution Option best meets stakeholder needs. By juxtaposing the stakeholder value of each Solution Option against its costs, <i>DecisionMaker</i> allows you to review the trade-offs between monetary investments and stakeholder values. 
        <br><br>The steps listed below link to Resources and Guidance that can help you practically work through a decision.  You can access these after you register and log in. You can also reach these pages from the black tool bar at the top of each page.
        <br><br>Throughout <i>DecisionMaker</i>, hovering over and/or clicking on the “i” icons will provide you with additional information. Clicking on the book icons will take you to a relevant Resources and Guidance page.
        <br><br>This free, online tool was developed for education decision-makers by the Center for Benefit-Cost Studies of Education at Teachers College, Columbia University (CBCSE) with funding from the William T. Grant Foundation. 
        <br><br> CBCSE worked with a state education agency, three school districts, three individual schools, and many current and aspiring school leaders in a principal preparation program at Teachers College to adapt the framework for educational contexts. 
        <br><br> The decision-making framework used in <i>DecisionMaker</i> is based on Multiattribute Utility Theory (MAUT) as developed by Edwards (1971), Edwards, Guttentag and Snapper (1975), and Edwards and Newman (1982). The <i>DecisionMaker</i> User Manual includes details about the methods.
