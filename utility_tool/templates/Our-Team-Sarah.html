        <p>Fiona Hollands is the Associate Director and Senior Researcher at the Center for Benefit-Cost Studies of Education at Teachers College, Columbia University. Fiona's research focuses on the effectiveness and costs of educational programs and strategies with the aim of demonstrating how education leaders and policymakers can optimize the use of resources in education. Recent and current studies address high school completion, early literacy, online learning, MOOCs, digital learning tools, automated detectors of learner affect and engagement, EdTech decision-making in higher education, and the benefits and costs to learners of earning "alternative credentials." <i>DecisionMaker</i><sup style="font-size:0.4em">TM</sup> is the product of Fiona’s conviction that cost-utility analysis can be usefully applied in education contexts to facilitate stakeholder engagement and evidence-based decision-making.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Prior to becoming an education researcher, Fiona worked in the international financial securities industry at J.P. Morgan in London, Paris, and New York.
